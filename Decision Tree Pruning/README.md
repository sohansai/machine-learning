# Decision Tree Pruning

This folder contains code to explore the problem of overfitting in decision trees and develop a solution using pruning techniques.

## Description

The aim of this problem is to demonstrate how overfitting can occur in decision trees and showcase the effectiveness of pruning techniques in addressing this issue.

## Code

The code provided in this folder demonstrates various steps involved in decision tree pruning. It includes the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Grid Search Cross-Validation for Hyperparameter Tuning
3. Evaluating the Model Performance on Training and Test Sets
4. Cost Complexity Pruning
5. Plotting AUC-ROC Scores vs. Alpha

## Dataset

The code uses the "breast-cancer.csv" dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook named "Decision_Tree_Pruning.ipynb".

3. Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially to see the results and plots.
