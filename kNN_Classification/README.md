# kNN Classification

This folder contains the code that implements the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset. It explores different values of k to evaluate the model's performance on the training and testing datasets.

## Requirements

- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries: pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:  kNN_Classification.ipynb
3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and visualize the results.
